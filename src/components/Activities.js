                Garbage collectors are responsible for collecting, transporting,
                and disposing of waste materials. Some common activities of
                garbage collectors include: Collection of waste: Garbage
                collectors are responsible for collecting waste from various
                sources, such as residential areas, commercial establishments,
                and industrial sites. They use specialized vehicles like garbage
                trucks to collect and transport waste to the designated landfill
                or waste treatment facility. Sorting and segregation: Garbage
                collectors often sort and segregate the waste materials they
                collect. This is important for separating recyclable materials
                like plastics, glass, and metal from non-recyclable waste like
                food waste and hazardous waste. Recycling: Many garbage
                collectors also play a key role in recycling activities. They
                work to identify and separate recyclable materials from the
                waste stream, and then transport those materials to recycling
                facilities for processing. Disposal of hazardous waste: Garbage
                collectors must handle hazardous waste with care. They often
                work with specialized equipment and follow strict safety
                protocols to ensure that hazardous materials are transported and
                disposed of safely. Our goal is to create a society that is
                cleaner and healthier. Nisarga not only reduces the need for
                manpower and human resources, but it also saves time, energy,
